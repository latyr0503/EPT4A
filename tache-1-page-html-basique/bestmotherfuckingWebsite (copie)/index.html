    <h1>The <em>best</em> montherfucking website.</h1>
    <p>
        For real
    </p>
    <h2>
        Styling?
    </h2>
    <p>
        You probably build websites using vim and you think that's hardcore. You think your 4.99KB
        <span>motherfuckingwebsite</span> (.com) is going to get you some award to put on your damn footer as a link.
        You think your
        default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.
        <br><br>
        Well, guess what, you're <span>WRONG</span> , motherfucker.
    </p>
    <h2>
        The best kick-ass website
    </h2>
    <p>
        Let me describe the <i>real</i> perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past
        <span>motherfuckingwebsites</span> :
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed) </li>
        <li>
            The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the <a href="https://google.com/">Google home page</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your 16x32 Tamagotchi, I'm sorry) </li>
        <li>
            Looks <i>almost</i> the same on every screen
        </li>
        <li>
            Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem <span>well, kind of</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            It's accessible, so everyone can enjoy it <span>but not everyone can read this - this text is
                Ant-Accessible</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            Shit is <i>even</i> more legible than the fucking two previous versions - and it also has a cleanish style
            without
            looking like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">ARPANET</a> website
        </li>
        <li>
            Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people who still use <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">IPoAC</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Uses only free and open-source resources, like this awesome font called "Open Sans" <span>which btw weighs
                15.21kB, wtf</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            It doesn't load your glorious jQuery or jQueryUI with all their fucking styles and shits. Nor Angular or any
            other framework. This website is proudly made with plain HTML5, CSS3 and JS. Keep it Vanilla!
        </li>
        <li>
            Doesn't include any tracking service this website does, but hey, I gotta see who visits me!
        </li>

        <li>
            Images aren't forbidden, but when SVG is available <i>JUST USE IT.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
            Use <i>some</i> fucking <span>colors</span> .
        </li>
        <li>
            Links don't really need to keep that <span>shitty blue</span> the browser is giving them: nor that <span>violetish color</span> when
            they are marked as visited. Just give them a <a href="http://www.colorhexa.com/0077aa">nice color</a> 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Well guess what, motherfucker:
    </h2>
    <p>
        This website is even better than the last <a href="../BetterMotherFuckingWebsite/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guy</a> and the <a href="../motherfuckingwebsite/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guy before him.</a> 
        <br><br>
        Why?
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            It's over a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">secure connection</a> - so nobody can spy what we're serving to (the page might be different for everyone, pshht!).
        </li>
        <li>
            It uses one of the most general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gTLD">gTLDs</a> available out there : .website
        </li>
        <li>
            It uses the TLD, too: thebestmotherfucking.website, check out <a href="http://domainr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> domainr</a> to do something cool too.
        </li>
        <li>
            It uses the kickass <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/"> Let's Encrypt</a> CA (don't you see the gorgeous lock?)
        </li>
    </ul>
